Old buildings and new galleries echo each other, and individual shops of costume boxes and jewelry are in a row, which makes the atmosphere here more dense and elegant. Small streets are somewhat similar to the art world and creative paradise in China. We came in the spring of Korea. Colorful flowers dot the alleys. The subtle fragrance of tea and Korean cuisine fills every corner of the alley. Here, in addition to some souvenirs, we can also find some girls&#39;favorite clothes. Galleries renovated from traditional Korean houses, cafes decorated with modern decoration, restaurants with a long history...
