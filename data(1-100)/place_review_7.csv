I walked from the subway station to the entrance of the park. I saw a long long dragon waiting for the shuttle bus. There were more than ten people in a car. I needed to wait for more time. So I went directly to the entrance of the stairs. Although the sky turned cold, But don&#39;t go through more clothes, finally go to the 290-level hilltop walk more than ten meters Ping Road, you will see the official entrance of Sky Park on the left hand side will have pink grass and bobo grass, the rest are a large awn grass no matter how long the shuttle bus waiting or the physical labor of walking up the mountain. The movement is worth seeing in front of you, it is amazing that we went in mid-May, the grass is knee high. It is very important to ask when to start pruning the lawn, otherwise you may miss the beautiful scenery. There are signs of frogs infestation, so be careful if you are as prone to being scared by frogs as I am. It is important to enter the park from the foot of the mountain, not anywhere else...why? Because there you can ride up the hill instead of walking 950 meters up the mountain:) Trust me, you will want to try riding down.",4.0,2019-12-31 20:37:54

Here are five Korean-style traditional houses scattered throughout the city, which are relocated to the scenic spots built here in a unified and centralized manner. There are not only the Royal courtyards of the Korean era (1392-1910), but also the living quarters of the common people. The scale and furniture of the houses also strive to reflect the original scene. The tour guide said that because Hangou Village in South Valley exhibits the shape and structure of Hangou House, which is totally different from Chinese or Japanese architectural styles, it is not only popular with foreign tourists, but also a place for Koreans living in modern apartments to experience Hangou culture quickly and accurately. Here we can see the epitome of Korean traditional culture. As the evening is approaching, the shops and experience venues in Hanwu Village in the South Valley are dying down. Under the guidance of tour guides, we quickly browse through several courtyards. It is no longer a reflection of tourism, but a reflection of the browsing of the Internet age, very helpless with group tourism. Several young girls in our tour group seem to be tired of watching the scenery, maybe they are eager to go shopping. They leave the group and take the initiative to give up their dinner before entering the scenic spot, and go to Dongmen Commercial Street to continue shopping by themselves. Tourists of different ages do have different demands for traveling abroad. Driving for more than 30 minutes in the traffic jam of the late rush hour in the city, we arrived at the place where we had dinner. Today&#39;s dinner is Korean-style stone pot rice.
