It feels a bit like Beijing Art Park 798, but it is a bit more cute. The whole area of Huihua University Road is full of street shops, especially suitable for young girls, it is simply Taobao&#39;s paradise. Lovely stationery, creative furnishings, clothing and groceries are dazzling, and the price is particularly approachable. There are often 2,000 won/person hair decoration sales. Shopping here must manage your time and wallet. Although the price here is close to the people, women have lost their immunity completely when they arrive here, and it will take more than half a day in a blink of an eye. In addition to Taobao, there are two things to do on Daxue Road, one is to find a place to sit down and have a drink from the many cafes; the other is to go to the Lihuadong mural village where the fire was a handful in the &quot;House Tower Wang Shizi&quot;.",4.0,2016-02-01 11:42:18
