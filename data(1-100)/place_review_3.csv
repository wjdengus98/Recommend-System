From a distance, you can see that the terrain of Korea is high and low, and it is a ladder, and you can overlook the entire palace from a high place. Unlike the Beijing Forbidden City, which is flat, you can&#39;t see the inside from the outside. Like Gyeongboo Palace, Changde Palace is a Chinese-style palace on the Korean Peninsula, and at the same time has the uniqueness of the combination of palaces and gardens, which is completely designed according to natural terrain. It is the most natural palace in North Korea. Therefore, although Changde Palace is also facing north and south, its palace is not distributed according to the north-south central axis like Jingfu Palace, but arranged in turn from the southwest to the northeast according to the terrain from the southwest to the northeast. The Changde Palace is mainly divided into four parts: the foreign dynasty, the Zhi Dynasty, the Yan Dynasty and the back garden. Although the Changde Palace is built according to the Beijing Forbidden City, it is still very Korean in many aspects. The biggest difference is that South Korea likes to build palaces in the original ecological gardens, and China builds gardens after the palaces. The palace pavilion of Changde Palace is completely designed according to natural terrain. From the floor plan, the palace distribution is not regular, which is also the most unique aspect of Korean architecture. Changde Palace is the most natural palace in the Korean palace, with views throughout the year and the most complete palace in the Korean palace. The back garden is wide and beautiful, and there are gardens in each valley, such as Furong Pool, Ailian Pool, Guanlan Pool, Zunde Pool and other lotus pools. In the vicinity of Yuliuchuan, build Xiaoyao Pavilion, Qinghui Pavilion, Taiji Pavilion and other elegant and exquisite pavilions, to set off the natural environment more beautiful.

After the palace of Changde Palace, along the mountain path that runs back to the entrance of the back garden, suddenly suddenly open when it is almost at the end, Furong Pool and the surrounding pavilions are the first area. Furong Pool is square, and a round island is built in the center of the pool, reflecting the world view of the round place. The south of Furong Pool stands the Furong Pavilion facing the north, and there is a small Sijing Keebei Pavilion to the west of Furong Pool; facing Furong Pool, there is a fish water gate to the north; follow the slope behind her, on the flower street that forms the altar, on the wide platform above the south tower of the two-story pavilion-style Zeus building.

We chose the only one of the five palaces to be included in the UNESCO World Heritage Site &quot;Changde Palace&quot; because &quot;this is the only ancient palace in Korea that has not been destroyed and has always maintained its original appearance; secondly, there are fewer tourists and it is clean. In order to protect this precious heritage, Changde Palace was once forbidden to visit. However, since 2010, the scenic spots besides the Secret Garden have been opened to the outside world (the Secret Garden must be visited within the prescribed time, accompanied by tour guides). Many people on the Internet disdain Korea&#39;s ancient palace. I don&#39;t think that because Chinese culture is broad and profound, we can despise the cultural heritage of other countries. Although there is no magnificent atmosphere of the Forbidden City, many architectural elements are influenced by Chinese culture, but the Korean Palace has its own small jasper temperament, simple refinement, ingenuity in detail. Although there are obvious traces of ancient Chinese architecture, it is not difficult to find out why the unique &quot;Han flavor&quot; elements of the Changde Palace can become a world cultural heritage. I think it is not unrelated to the perfect integration of its architecture and the surrounding natural environment. Behind the Changde Palace, there is a huge backyard, Secret Garden, built on the hill and integrated with the natural environment. It is the essence of the whole palace.

The border is located in the middle and back of Changde Palace, which is the junction of the main palace group and the secret garden. The Changde Palace is the second palace built by the Korean dynasty after the Jingfu Palace. It is located on the east side of the Jingfu Palace. It is called &quot;Dongguan&quot; with the Changqing Palace built later, which means the exit palace on the east side of the Jingfu Palace. In the early 17th century, the Chande Palace and Gyeongboo Palace were destroyed due to the chaos of the Japanese invaders. Due to the small size of Changde Palace, based on financial considerations, the monarch at that time gave priority to rebuilding Changde Palace, and after briefly living in the Deshou Palace, the Changde Palace was officially used as a main palace, and it continued until the middle and late 19th century before moving back to Jingfu Palace again. Although the palace was derelict for more than 20 years, it was dramatic that the palace returned to its monarchy in the early 20th century, the last emperor of the last dynasty, and witnessed the demise of the Korean Peninsula. Interestingly, although the reputation of Changde Palace in China is much smaller than that of Gyeongboo Palace, the editor recommended this on the well-known travel book &quot;LONELY PLANET&quot;: If you only have enough time to visit a Seoul ancient palace, then the first choice is necessarily Changde Palace.

Coming here by coincidence, I fell in love with it at first sight. I went to Korea with a good friend and reported to a semi-free group. Through a website, I found an overseas student in Korea. She wanted to translate something for us when she was shopping. The fee was 280 yuan per day. She happened to study in this school. She told us that Lihua Women&#39;s University is not all female students, and there are also 30 [% male students in the school. The Lihua Women&#39;s College is not like a university at all. Even many parks can&#39;t compare with it. The buildings of the school have retro style and modern style. It&#39;s autumn when they go. In fact, the two most famous ones here are the pear flower wall carved in that edition. It&#39;s not far from the entrance. The other one is the Christian Church. The Christian Church is very easy to identify. There is a cross on the top, and the style is similar to that in China. In the school, a large area of Maple Ridge, maple leaves are almost dyed red, and many fell to the ground covered with soil, very beautiful. Everywhere I go, I can get the feeling of Korean opera, and there are many beautiful girls in school. When I go, I have to wear several clothes. They even show their thighs outside, and they admire them very much. If you want to see more beautiful women go to the sinking square, where there are many female students playing the violin, between 4 and 5 p.m. The self-study room in the school is transparent. Many students can be seen reading there and sleeping there. The study room is similar to that in Korean dramas. Tickets for Lihua Women&#39;s University are unnecessary. It takes three hours to finish the tour. It is located about 200 meters away from exit 2 and 3 of Lida Station on Line 2. Taxi drivers in Seoul can hardly understand English. It&#39;s better to write a note to their teachers in Korean. The starting price is 3000 won (within two kilometers). After more than two kilometers, they will charge 100 won per 148 meters. There is a street opposite the school. There are a lot of things in the street. Clothes, cosmetics and snacks are all available. Some of them are much cheaper than the open cave. The quality is very good. Cosmetics are all domestic photographs. In addition, snacks are also very special. There are many people going to eat.
