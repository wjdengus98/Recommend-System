The World Cup Park and the stadium are separate, and there is also the World Cup Memorial Hall inside the World Cup Stadium. You need to pay 1,000 won when you enter. There are no souvenirs to buy, just look at old photos and visit the venue. It is generally operated all year round, and the museum is customized on holidays. The scenery outside the World Cup Park is very good, and it is a very popular place for citizens. Especially several of the major parks , The environment is good, nothing to say, and it is also a good place to take pictures. Compared with other parks introduced later, it is a bit monotonous and not very interesting."""
