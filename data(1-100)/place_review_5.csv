The indoor complex houses roller coasters, water rides, children&#39;s rides, plenty of restaurants, arcade games, monorail, shops and a huge ice skating rink among others. I went during the winter and so it was nice and warm inside the complex. The indoor complex is connected to the outdoor complex called Magic Island which houses more extreme rides like drop zone and other rides for the intrepid. The monorail can connect the two compexes together. The whole idea was great and anyone would love going to Lotte World, but I went during the holiday season and the place was PACKED! It took over an hour for a popular waterlog ride and during the line up, a lot of Korean teenagers were pushing and cutting lines, which made the experience unpleasant. The complex was also not as clean as famous theme parks like Disneyland and Six Flags, lots of grafitti on some of the walls.But all in all, this is a place to visit especially if you bring your kids along.",5.0,2024-07-30 13:23:07
