After the opening, the Seoul Theater has set up 3 theaters, which is the earliest multiplex theater in Korea. Now, it is a multiplex cinema with 7 screening halls. Allegedly, to judge whether a movie is popular in the market, you can only know by its release in the Seoul theater. The Seoul Theater is a mainstream theater with such influence. Movie actors often hold meet-and-greets or autograph sessions here, so if you're lucky, you might be able to meet the characters in the movie! Seoul theaters often show local Korean films. There are fast food restaurants, shops and ice cream parlors in the theater, so you can refuel when you are hungry. There are also many delicious street food stalls in front of the square, such as grilled squid, grilled pufferfish, fried potato chips, etc. It is another fun to buy some to try. There is a spacious lounge on the 4th floor of the theater, providing a place to rest and relax for weary audiences."
