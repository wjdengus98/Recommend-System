Korean ticketing is indoors, domestic and other outdoors are the most obvious difference. Secondly, there is no obvious instructions for picking up tickets, all relying on circle and good-hearted people to inform. Then, the most speechless thing is the operation of the system. At the beginning, I provided my passport and sbs account as required, and there was no seat information when I arrived at the scene. From 12 noon to the scene, I queued to fill in the information to inform the problem, and it took time to wait until 2:30 pm. The result was until 5:30, and the official began to manually write the seat number. As a result, the seat number was heavy, and the information was called to the venue to confirm the information, delaying the performance. The ticket bought was finally arranged in the station pit.
