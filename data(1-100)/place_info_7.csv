It is a grass park in the second construction site of Lanzhi Island. It used to be an area with poor soil on Lanzhi Island. Sky Park is famous for its 291 steps, from which you can overlook the panoramic view of Seoul. Boundless Grass Sky Park is characterized by a vast expanse of grass. The ridge line made for the convenience of drainage is the boundary line, and it is divided into 4 areas according to the X-shape. The taller grass is planted on the north and south sides, and the short grass is planted on the east and west sides. In the north of the tall grasslands, there are purple awns. In the rippling purple awn group, citizens can feel the nature. In the low grasslands, there are native varieties such as large thistle, violet and bitterweed, and naturalized varieties such as white alfalfa. Among them, white alfalfa can help other plants grow and promote soil decomposition, which is a very suitable plant for places like Laneige Island. Since 2,000 years ago, more than 30,000 butterflies, including yellow butterflies, blue swallowtail butterflies, nymph butterflies, and golden swallowtail butterflies, have been released on Lanzhi Island with Sky Park as the center. In spring and early summer, butterflies flying in the sky help pollinate plants, which has greatly contributed to the stability of the plant ecosystem in Laneige Island. Another feature of walking up the stairs and looking at Yuanjing Sky Park is that there will be 219 steps along the road, and each step is marked with numbers. Walking up the steps is like walking towards the sky step by step, standing in the Sky Park on Lanzhi Island. From here, the scenery of Seoul catches your eye at a glance, with Bukhan Mountain in the north, Namsan Mountain and 63 Building in the east gate, Han River in the south, and Lucky State Mountain Fortress in the west. In order to take full advantage of such excellent viewing conditions, there is an observation deck on the inclined surface, so that visitors can rest at any time. The bushes outside the park are 1~1.5m higher than the grass, and many large trees like oaks are planted to allow visitors to rest in the shade."
