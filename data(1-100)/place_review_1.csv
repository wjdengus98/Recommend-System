The park was stunning for the first time, with evergreen trees, and a seemingly ancient white stone wall erected in a different style that separated the park from the bustling city. Walk up the slope of the roadside, the sky is blue and blue, black lampposts against the white stone wall, the surrounding is very quiet, it seems to hear the sound of air vibration, time is as still. Very beautiful. At the end of the slope was the open square, with several sculptures and a memorial hall, but we didn&#39;t go in. Surprisingly, standing on the square, you can see the N Seoul Tower standing on the top of the mountain, it seems to be close at hand, and there is a climbing ladder through the square (the sign of the N Seoul Tower on the side of the square), pick up the stairs, about half an hour to reach the N Seoul Tower (the ladder is relatively gentle, Easy to climb).

When I arrived at the hotel, I mentioned the changing ceremony of Gyeongboo Palace in a brochure at first sight, so I set off to visit Gyeongboo Palace the next day. There was no special arrangement, but it was a coincidence that I arrived at Gyeongboo Palace. When I arrived at Gyeongboo Palace, I saw the guards in traditional court costumes in a queue. I shouted slogans and walked out and walked in. It seemed that I just caught up with the changing ceremony. Although I didn&rsquo;t understand what I shouted during the period, I still felt that kind of momentum. As for the interior of the palace, I didn&rsquo;t go in to visit, because I encountered some misunderstandings on the Internet to buy tickets, so I was a bit unhappy. I didn&#39;t feel in the mood to visit again, I went directly to other places. But after communicating with the Trip.com platform, the platform gave a good solution.

The interior of Gyeongboo Palace has many exquisite buildings and courtyards to enjoy the traditional Korean court culture and architectural style. Gyeongboo Palace is also a good place to take pictures, whether it is day or night, there are different beauty. I recommend that you rent a set of Hanfu before visiting Gyeongboo Palace, so that you can enter Gyeongboo Palace for free, and take pictures in front of the classical building, it will have a more atmosphere and feeling. I rented a set of Hanfu rental shops in Xihua Hanfu near Gyeongbokgung Palace. The clerk was very enthusiastic and helped me compile and choose accessories. There are many styles of Hanfu, traditional and modern, and you can choose according to your preferences. After entering Gyeongboo Palace, I first saw the Hing Li Gate, which is where the keeper change ceremony was held. The change ceremony is a spectacular and interesting re-enactment of the keeper&#39;s military ceremony in Korea. You can also try on the keeper&#39;s costumes before and after the change ceremony, or take a photo with the keeper. The changing ceremony is several times a day, and it is recommended to check the schedule in advance. Then I visited places such as Qinzheng Palace, Sizheng Palace, Zishan Hall, Qinghui Building, Kangning Palace, Lushan and Xiangyuan Pavilion. Each place has its own characteristics and stories, and you can learn more through audio guides or guided materials. My favorite is the Gyeonggi Building, a building located above the square lake, very beautiful and elegant. There are reflections on the lake, which is perfect for taking pictures. Gyeongboo Palace is one of the must-visit attractions in Seoul. You can not only feel the history and culture of Korea, but also experience the fun of wearing Korean clothes and eating ginseng chicken soup. If you also want to visit Gyeongboo Palace, please remember to plan the time and route in advance, and close the museum every Tuesday.",5.0,2023-07-15 23:36:48
