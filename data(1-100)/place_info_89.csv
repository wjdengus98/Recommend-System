Sheji Park is located in the city and is a resting place that citizens often like to visit. Joseon Taejo set up an altar here to worship the god of earth and the god of grain in 3 years, but the worship activities were completely suspended in 1894, and in the late 1960s, it was once occupied by the Sajik Zoo. After the activities to restore the original appearance of Sheji Park were carried out, the Sheji Zoo was moved from here, the altar was restored, and from April 1994, the sacrificial activities were resumed. Sheji Park is full of trees and lush flowers and plants, especially around April 15 every year when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom. Because of the electric lights set up in the park, citizens can enjoy the beauty of the cherry blossoms even at night. In the park, there are the altar restored in 1993, the Gwangju Broadcasting Bureau (KBS), the Police Chunghun Pagoda, the rafter pavilion (built and donated by Mr. Jung Nak Kyo, who lived in Yangrim-dong), the shooting range Gwangdeok pavilion, and the octagonal pavilion where you can look around the city of Gwangju."
