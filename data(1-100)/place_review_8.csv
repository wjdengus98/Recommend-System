It&#39;s amazing and worth visiting for its business hours - &quot;10:30-18:00&quot; per capita - &quot;60 yuan Lee um Art Museum name comes from Lee of Samsung family and Museum of British Museum. The exterior of the museum shows the image of the ancient Seoul city surrounded by the city wall with red bricks, giving people a quiet and profound artistic atmosphere, which is absolutely a good place for young literary and artistic people. From Korean national treasure traditional art to modern art and world art, the entrance ticket is 10,000 won. The total number of visitors is 2 museums, Museum 1 and Museum 2. Museum1 exhibits ancient works of art, inspired by the famous Swiss architect Mario Botta from Korean traditional ceramics. It uses red pottery symbolizing earth and fire to represent it. Simple cubes and inverted conical shapes resemble the symbols of Mario Bota&#39;s architectural design, displaying more than 120 Korean ceramics from prehistoric times to Korean times. Museum 2 exhibits modern works, designed by Jean Nouvel, a French architect. It is the earliest Museum in the world to use stainless steel and glass. Its design features retaining the underground wall shape that naturally occurs when foundations are laid. With the theme of &quot;East-West blending&quot;, it shows the artistic exchange and collision between the East and the West at the same time. The Samsung Children&#39;s Education and Culture Center designed by Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas highlights the sense of future space, but it is not open. Interestingly, the starting point of the exhibition here is from the top to the bottom, that is to say, first take the elevator to the top floor, and then go down one floor. Photographs are not allowed in the collection. They can be taken anywhere else. My favorite staircase is the second floor.

88523,https://ak-d.tripcdn.com/images/1h66f4224x8bzcytc0468.jpg,山水人生,"Located opposite the building of the Korean Ministry of Defense, the War Memorial is the site of the army headquarters of the Republic of Korea. It is said to be the largest war-themed Memorial in the world. The square in front of the memorial hall carries the national flags of many countries. For historical reasons, of course, there is no bright five-star red flag here. Despite different ideologies and different interpretations of the war 60 years ago, the sculptures in front of the square are quite touching. The first thing you see is the famous statue of brothers, two brothers standing on a split hemisphere in the middle, symbolizing the North-South split of the Korean Peninsula. The text introduction before the statue says that the sculpture takes the true story of the Korean War as the theme, depicting a pair of brothers (brother is a South Korean officer, brother is a Korean People&#39;s Army soldier) as the combat opponent, meeting unexpectedly in the war and embracing each other closely. Walking into the hemispheric chamber under the statue, you can see sculptures reflecting war pictures. The giant bullet sculpture on the front of the Plaza of the War Memorial, named &quot;a cracked bullet&quot;, is surrounded by sculptures of officers, soldiers and people moving forward bravely. Standing in the distance and looking at the cracked bullet sculpture, it looks so striking against the city&#39;s tall buildings. What a horrible story war is and what a wonderful wish peace is. Beside the tree-covered road, there is also a dusty clock of peaceful reunification, which had hoped to function as soon as possible. Now the clock has been solidified in its original position. The national reunification of the Korean Peninsula, like this clock, is still in a state of suspension in the gray layer. On the other side of the square stands a huge stone tablet. According to the text, it is a widely opened tomb tablet of the earth king. The original is in Chi&#39;an City, China. This is an imitation in front of us. Next to the multi-national text briefly introduced the territory of Koguryo in its heyday. According to the records, this broad-open earth king was the nineteenth-generation monarch of Koguryo. During his reign, Koguryo&#39;s separatist sphere of influence reached its peak. In the north, including parts of northeast China east of Liaohe River, the area of the Korean Peninsula reached half of the peninsula area, that is, the traditional four prefectures of Han Dynasty. As a result, the king&#39;s achievements are recorded on the mausoleum erected for him by his son, the Longevity King, which is said to be one of the largest inscribed tablets in the world. By the time of Korean tourism, we often heard tour guides proudly mention the Koguryo era, which was extinct more than 1300 years ago, while the regime lasted for more than 700 years. There has been a dispute about the historical ownership between Chinese and Korean academic circles. At present, Chinese, Korean and Korean officials have basically reached a consensus on this, that is, to put aside historical disputes and remain silent. It also reproduces the so-called &quot;shelving diplomacy&quot; success story. It seems that human beings can solve disputes with more intelligence than war.",5.0,2014-08-03 22:38:47

The photo is a souvenir (free), with the bump stamp of the United Nations on it, and the following can be any country participating in the war.
