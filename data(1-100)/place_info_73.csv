Its functions include being responsible for taekwondo dan rank examinations and issuing dan rank certificates, and engaging in taekwondo research work. Kokugiwon is the only legal dan awarding organization recognized by the World Taekwondo Federation (WTF). WTF itself does not issue dan or black belt certificates. In fact, the WTF and Kokugiwon are two separate organizations, but they are often confused, for example, ""WTF"" is often referred to as Kokugiwon-style taekwondo."
