Sujingmun is located in the north of Seoul, with Gyeongbokgung as the center, and Changuimun (Zixiamun) on the right side, like two wings. If people move here, the dragon veins may be damaged, and the country may be in crisis, so in the 13th year of King Taejong (1413), the pine trees were planted and the passage was prohibited. After that, Sujingmun was used as a walking path, and it became a restricted area following the North Korean armed intrusion incident in 1968. In April 2006, the government planned to open the city of Seoul around Beiyueshan, so Sujingmen reopened. In April 2007, Beiyueshan was opened again, and it was divided into 3 visiting routes. Bukaksan Mountain, which has been closed to traffic for many years, has a well-preserved natural environment, and the panoramic view of Seoul can be seen from the mountain."
