The subway goes to the Independent Gate Station, and the park is easy to find. We entered from the middle, intending to go to the Criminal Museum first, and then take pictures at the independent entrance. The greening of the park is very good. Although the sun was very strong on the day I went, it was not difficult to find shade. A short walk along the main road is the Criminal Museum. The museum, formerly a prison, was used to imprison South Korean independence fighters during the Japanese aggression. I have long known the cruelty of Japanese militarism, but by visiting this museum, I have greatly deepened my impression that the overall atmosphere of the museum is very gloomy and terrible. Although the memories left by the museum are not good, Ximen Park as a whole is a very good place - &quot;dense trees, fresh air, beautiful environment, most of them are parents-in-law on weekdays. It&#39;s a relaxing and comfortable scene to bask in the sun or do some slow sports (no square dancing, of course). At the end of the journey in the opposite direction is the independent door. The scenery around the Independence Gate is very beautiful. It&#39;s absolutely an excellent place for photographic friends. Look at the pictures. Interestingly, when I visited it, I always thought that the Independence Gate was built to commemorate Korea&#39;s defeat of Japanese ghosts and its national independence. However, when I came back to search for information, I found that was not the case. The predecessor of the Independence Gate was Ying&#39;en Gate, which was originally built by the DPRK in response to the envoys of the Ming Dynasty. Later, at the end of the 19th century, the Qing Dynasty was forced to abandon its patriarchal status to Korea because of its defeat in the Sino-Japanese War and the signing of the &quot;Treaty of Maguan&quot;. In order to celebrate its departure from China&#39;s patriarchal rule, the Koreans changed Ying&#39;en Gate into an independent gate and invited foreign architects to redesign and build it.",4.0,2016-04-23 16:28:28
