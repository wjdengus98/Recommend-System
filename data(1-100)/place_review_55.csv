Walking on the inside of the wall (with the best view of the city), then back outside the wall to get some good photos of the wall. Bring water (especially in summer), hats, good shoes and cameras. There are plenty of places to stop on the way to Naksan Park (this track can be used as a fitness track and there are lots of shaded seats). There are some places with stones along the way, some places without padding. Not very suitable for young children. Maybe like many people, we just stumbled upon this wall while looking for a golden-mixed house (the drama of Minister Kim KD). The trip was both exciting and enjoyable. The wall spans all types of blocks, so you can always find one of the many restaurants and convenience stores to stop for snacks. Please wear comfortable shoes as taxis don&rsquo;t pass often so you end up walking a lot beyond expectations. Tip: These trees are beautiful depending on the season.

It is designed as a historic attraction and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Open Tuesday to Sunday, in a forest-like site. Motorcycles, buses, taxis are easy to reach. If you want to walk in the summer, remember to bring a bottle of water, even if you can find a fountain inside. The mausoleum is a five-minute walk from the hotel I stayed in. I went on a weekday, around 8 o&#39;clock, and there were many elderly Koreans doing morning exercises. The mausoleum is very interesting, with stone guards on the mound at the top. You can only walk to two of them and see the scenery from the side of the top, but that is enough. Tickets are 1,000 won and very cheap. I spent time walking in the park and it was lovely. There was a very, very old ginkgo tree, many cranberries and persimmon trees, and when I went there it all came fruit. The beautiful Japanese maple tree was the red leaves of autumn.
