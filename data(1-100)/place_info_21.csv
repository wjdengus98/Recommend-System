Ying En Gate is the place where the king personally greeted the Chinese envoys. Since 1897, Russia has declared Korea's independence to Japan and Russia, which have long threatened China and Korea. The cost of building the independent gate is donated by all the citizens. Now there are only two goalposts of Yingenmen left in front of the independent gate, but it can still make people imagine what it looked like at the time. Seeing the independent gate can not help but remind people of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, France, because it imitates the architectural style of the Arc de Triomphe. The independent gate is made of granite and is 14.28 meters high, with road access below. The word ""Independent Gate"" is written in Korean on the independent door, and the Taiji flag is painted on both sides. On the left inner side of the independent door there are steps leading to the roof. Hibiscus flowers are planted around, and roads are built around the independent gate. You can see the style of the independent gate from the car."
