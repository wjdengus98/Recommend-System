When the Han River was filled, part of the waterway was cut off and it became a lake. Then it flourished and became Shicun Lake Park. After Songpo Road was completed, Shicun Lake Park was divided into East Lake and West Lake. Nearby citizens like to go to East Lake, while those who come to West Lake are mainly tourists who go to ""Magic Iceland"". The park is beautifully repaired and the scenery is beautiful. In the morning, residents will be seen doing morning exercises, which can be close to the daily life of the Korean people.
