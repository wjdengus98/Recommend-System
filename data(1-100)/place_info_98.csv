Its peak is Ziyunbong (739.5m), and there are also other strange mountains such as Manjangbong, Xianrenbong, Jubong, Wubong, and Ueram. In addition, Dobong Mountain has also built 37 special climbing routes for tourists who like rock climbing. Among the more than 60 temples in Bukhan Mountain and Dobong Mountain, Tianzhu Temple and Wangwol Temple are more characteristic of building temples suddenly. It is a good choice for nearby Seoul citizens to take a day trip to Dobong Mountain."
