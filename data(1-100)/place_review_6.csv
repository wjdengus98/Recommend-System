The outline of the blue brick is contrasting, adding a point of peace and historical precipitation to the church. The interior of the church is large and bright. When we went there, we didn&#39;t dare to take pictures inside the church because we happened to meet the Mass, but the exquisite window paintings, wide spaces and bright environment inside, plus the tune of the chant, will unconsciously make people feel holy and happy.
