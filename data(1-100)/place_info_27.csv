There are performances here as soon as they come, and street painters also improvise paintings for tourists. A must-see on Wolmi Island is the amusement park. Although not comparable to other large-scale theme parks, the amusement park is famous for Apollodisco and pirate ships. Thrilling pirate ships attract tourists from all over the country, and Apollodisco is a lot of fun even just looking around.
