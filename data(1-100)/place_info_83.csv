It is a favorite resting place for Seoul citizens and a local tourist attraction. The towering peaks and deep canyons create steep mountains. Although the scale of Gwanaksan is small, it is relatively close to the city center, and it is enough to climb the mountain in one day. In spring, there are rhododendrons blooming here; in summer, there is thick green shade, and the sound of waterfalls can be heard in the deep valley; In addition, the top of Gwanaksan Mountain has an above-ground radar observation station, as well as large and small temples and temples including Yeonjusa Temple and Wongyaksa Temple. It is also worth a visit."
