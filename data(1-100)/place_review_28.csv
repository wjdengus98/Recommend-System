It&#39;s fitting to come here and learn about the history of Korean Chinese. In the past, most of the shops selling Chinese products here are now Chinese restaurants. In addition, I would like to remind you that most of the Chinese living in Chinatown today are descendants of the second or third generation of early immigrants. Almost everyone has become Korean. The &quot;Chinese Heart&quot; has become very thin, but Chinese cuisine is still very authentic. The Chinese red people in the streets can still feel a strong Chinese flavor. According to my personal experience, the Chinese city must experience a few - &quot;1, fried sauce noodles (Korean people say the most famous is Republican Spring, but in fact this Republican Spring is no longer run by Chinese people, so you do not have to line up here to eat, because there are many cheap and delicious fried sauce noodles in other homes. ) 2. Chinese and Japanese buildings. (This is because there was a clear distinction between the dynasty concessions and the Japanese concessions here. There are very obvious historical traces. We must look carefully at each building. Significant) 3. Chinese snacks. Many of these snacks are different from those now sold in China, such as desktop pineapple crisps.

But the time of taking the subway and taking the bus was the same. But the bus seemed to last until the subway changed, so I decided to go by bus. As a result, the bus didn&#39;t arrive until then. It took more than two hours to make three turns. With the help of a Korean uncle on the bus, he just went to Chinatown and asked me to follow him. So sometimes you can&#39;t trust Google Maps too much. I remember saying before that Chinatown in every country can&#39;t be missed. See how Chinese people live abroad. Compared with the countries they have visited before, they feel that Chinese people living in Korea are better than other countries. The restaurants are larger and the business is good.

It was winter, and there was a relatively short Bada Mountain behind, with a little snow. Half of the water can be seen on the top of the mountain. There are many simple places in the palace, and there are more people walking in the local area. Locals can play for free with their ID cards. Tourists need to pay tickets. The price is not expensive. It looks like RMB 20 or 30. Maybe the culture is different. In my opinion, there is really nothing to see. I see the ancient buildings being expanded next to it. I really can&#39;t understand the cultural value. If it is summer rain, it is worth visiting. There are more trees and you can breathe the fresh air. The local people go there for a walk at night, or take a look at the food festivals that are regularly held. It is said that it is a food festival, that is, fried noodles and fried rice cakes. . .
