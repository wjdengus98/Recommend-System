From the moment I stepped through the gates, it felt like I had been transported to a magical wonderland. 🌳✨ The park is massive, with towering trees, winding trails, and even a little stream that babbles away cheerfully. I spent hours just wandering around, taking in the sights and sounds of nature. But the real highlight? The animal attractions! 🦒🐘🦁 The zoo section is top-notch, with enclosures that mimic the animals&#39; natural habitats. I even got to witness a lion let out a mighty roar &ndash; talk about an adrenaline rush! 🦁And let&#39;s not forget the rides! 🎢 The Seoul Grand Park has its very own amusement park section, complete with rollercoasters, carousels, and all sorts of whimsical attractions that brought out the kid in me.If you find yourself in Seoul, do yourself a favor and carve out a day (or two!) to explore this urban oasis. Trust me, it&#39;s worth it! 🌴😎",4.0,2024-05-13 18:50:24
