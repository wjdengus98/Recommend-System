It is the north main entrance of Suwon Hwaseong Fortress. It is more grand than other city gates. You can stroll into the city gate and imagine the feelings of the ancients entering the city. From Changanmen to the right, the eastern half of Suwon Huacheng is a stone wall; from Changanmen to the left, the western half of Suwon Huacheng is constructed on a small hill. There are many steps and steep slopes, and the tour is tiring."
