According to the order of the ritual space, the eaves and roof height of the main hall and the Yongning hall are different, and the thickness of the pillars is different with the increase of the Lord, so they have unique specifications and indoor space shapes. There are many buildings in the temple, including the main hall and the permanent peace hall, which preserves the sacrifice, the musicians rehearsing there, the Hyangdaecheong preparing the sacrifice food, and the Subokbang where the junior management staff live. The main hall is the longest wooden building in Korea, but the style is too simple. There are two special roads in the temple, one for the soul and the other for the king who serves as the royal road sacrifice. The road is paved with blue bricks and stones, so it is different from the general road. The middle of the road was slightly higher than the left and right sides, only the king and the son could walk in the middle, and the officials went on the left and right sides. This means that the temple building in South Korea shows dignity and authority. Unlike the Chinese temples, you can see on the floor plan that the route is curved, not the Chinese temples straight forward. This is mainly because the buildings in South Korea are built in a natural environment, not as neat as China. But the same is true, the temple is surrounded by trees, ancient people thought the temple is a channel to reach heaven. Compared with the complex and gorgeous Chinese Tai Temple, the Seoul temple is characterized by a long facade, simple decoration and few colors. It is said to reflect the simple spirit of Confucianism. The main feature of Seoul&#39;s temple in the architectural layout is that it is built according to natural terrain, so unlike Chinese buildings, there is a unified central axis. From the appearance, the time-entering department, the canonical department, and the Yongning department have no unity, but the building is very clever to use the concept of order and moderation to successfully achieve the unity of the whole. The temple ritual and the temple ritual music are the ritual music of the ritual rituals, played by means of dance and singing. Each order of the temple sacrifice rituals, with the music called Pu Taiping and Zheng Daye as the center of gravity, played a lot of music, and sang songs that praised the merit of their ancestors, also called dance and dance. The red robes of &quot;musicians&quot; played beautiful music with objects such as stone, metal, wood, leather and silk during the sacrificial ceremony of their ancestors in South Korea, where the royal descendants of South Korea are held in Seoul on the first Sunday of May each year And their great achievements. 1: The main hall is 101 meters long and is the longest wooden building in Korea. From the outside, it looks like more than 20 columns and 19 doors, but the interior is all connected, except for the ornate patterned designs in the tire room where the medal table is served. The gate to the main hall is three, and the south gate is considered a place where only souls can enter. The east gate is used by the king, the son, and the ministers of the ancestral families who sacrifice, and the west gate is the place where musicians in charge of the music and dance are allowed to enter and leave. 2: The stairs leading to the main temple are shaped by clouds, indicating that they have gone from &quot;ground&quot; to &quot;heaven&quot;. 3: The Yongning Temple contains the meaning of &quot;long-term peace between the ancestors and the descendants of the king&quot;.",3.0,2017-08-13 09:04:39
