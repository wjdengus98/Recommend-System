I used the yahoo mailbox at the beginning and then I didn&#39;t receive confirm number. After receiving confirmation code, fill in, agree to the relevant terms, and then fill in the list of personnel as required, and complete it after filling in. Then you will be given a confirmed number, you can print it out and take it there. Remember to bring your passport. (If you forget the reservation number, don&#39;t worry, there is a TOUR REQUEST CONFIRMATION in the upper right corner of the official website, click in, fill in the information left at the beginning and confirm it. Sometimes when you call the name, you choose capitalization, but the typing shows lowercase. Don&#39;t worry, as long as you fill in the same as the passport, I thought that lowercase would not get in, and I also did ideological work with the partner. If I can&#39;t get in at noon, I will pay for the ginseng chicken soup. Later, it was okay to visit.
