It is not large in size, but it is full of warm atmosphere. The museum is very close to Bukchon Hanok Village, but because it is located in a small alley, it is not easy to find. Therefore, there are signs at the entrance of the alley. The outer wall of the museum is full of owls, and the flower pots on the path leading to the museum are also full of cute owl signs of the museum. The more you walk in, the more you will feel It's like entering a fairy tale world. There is a gray owl stone sculpture at the entrance of the museum. It is not big inside. It is a big room with some tables and chairs in the middle. A cup of tea and drinks is provided for visitors who come to visit. Visitors can also freely paint on the spot with the brush provided on the table to draw the owl in their hearts, and can stay in the museum. The exhibition room in the museum is surrounded by cabinets on three walls, which display all kinds of owls, decorations, practical utensils, wall clocks and picture frames. There are paintings, carvings, metal, and wood, as long as you can get anything you want, it can be an owl.
