Inhwa Lee's work is based on the theme of ""translucency"", one of the physical properties of white porcelain, and plans to exhibit about 20 new objects and 10 flat works in this exhibition. By capturing the ever-changing light in white porcelain, a material that never changes, and transferring the illusion of light to a flat surface, it is hoped that the fleeting moments in life can be remembered for a long time and find their meaning."
