149396378,잭슨 심 개인전 < 3PALETTE >,0.0,https://ak-d.tripcdn.com/images/0102y12000gdagkp4D859.jpg,Seoul,['Exhibitions'],GCJ02,37.580516,126.983889,"LUV Contemporary Art, 18-4, Bukchon-ro 7-gil, Jongno-gu, Seoul, Korea","LUV Contemporary Art is hosting the solo exhibition ""3 PALETTE"" by artist-in-residence Jackson Sim, and launching 20 new works from a new series. Jackson Sim, who does not hesitate to express messages that reflect the contemporary era and sublimate pure art into popular art, is not satisfied, but explores new aesthetic fields, presenting a new series in each exhibition. The artist often discovers new methods of art from her little daughter, and this time, while coloring with her child, she felt the beauty of unexpected shapes created by the mixing of different colors, which led to the creation of the ""Palette"" series. Jackson Sim sees traces of change, and different colors are mixed together to form beautiful shapes. The blocks of pigment and the free-flowing mixed colors are reminiscent of the palette, an artistic tool. The artist presents three different forms, seeking the reversal between tool and work, and the accidental effects of pigment flow, entanglement, mixing, and dynamic materials created by the artist's instinctive sense stand out. The artist no longer seeks philosophical insights or explanations from the audience, but immerses herself in the aesthetic composition, gradually approaching lyrical abstract forms. Cartoon characters from popular culture, reinterpreted with strong colors and improvisational lines, spread like a scent in the air in<Air and Rolling Roses >, but are ultimately reduced to colors in the palette, erasing even the smallest form that makes the characters recognizable. It happens. The colors of the real world observed by the artist are transformed into a text composed of words and color names, a format that contains fundamental questions about the nature of things. The artist reproduces objects seen by the naked eye on the canvas with colors, subverting the concept between our perceived reality and color. Here we discover that the color of an object cannot be explained in one way. Realizing that the definition of color promised by society (e.g. apples are red, milk is white) has been simplified, we expand our understanding of the essence. The author uses the masses as the source of aesthetics and cheerfully expresses the positivity of capitalism. Jackson Shim's sincere wishes, muse and innocent code return to the essence of painting, but we can find traces of our favorite innocent existence in this ecstatic flow of colors. We hope that when the audience sees Jackson Shim's palette, they can remember their own essence and desires and find their own colors."
