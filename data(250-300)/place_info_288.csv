Located in the Shilla Hotel in Seoul, Johyun Gallery’s elegant space becomes a canvas, inviting visitors to enter the work. The atypical composition that fills the city’s underground space evokes primal memories of origins, similar to the awe one feels when discovering ancient ruins buried beneath civilization. Visitors invited to interact with the work, as well as the light that gently spills into the work through the yellow windows, add a transcendental time and vitality to the two-dimensional and three-dimensional composition of black and white abstract letterforms."

However, recently, modern society is full of complex and contradictory phenomena that cannot be explained by simple past explanations. From a poststructuralist perspective, we begin to discover various cases through the media that allow us to understand more deeply the contradictions inherent in human life and social relations. This exhibition aims to reinterpret the complexity of modern society through the metaphor of ""cruel fairy tales"" and expand the symbols in fairy tales to the contemporary context. The metaphors of disability and prejudice revealed in the lines of the domestic TV series ""It's Okay to Be Bad 2020"" are an important starting point for the symbolic approach of this exhibition. Starting from the character's question ""Is it terrible to be different?"", the story of difference and fear, understanding and acceptance is linked to the fairy tale of Bluebeard, and the scene reflects the prejudices and fears of modern people. Since then, the story of Bluebeard has begun to be interpreted no longer as a simple cruel fairy tale, but as an important work symbolizing the story of women breaking taboos and gender conflicts. For example, works such as the music video of singer Le Seraphim's ""Eve, Psyche and Bluebeard's Wife"" and the Naver webtoon ""I Became Bluebeard's Wife"" are now reinterpreted in various cultural contents. This exhibition visually explores these themes through the collection of famous artists at home and abroad, such as In-ok Kim, Hwan-ki Kim, Seo-bo Park, U-hwan Lee, Seung-taek Jang, Nancy Lang, and David Gerstein."

The creek in front of the village is meandering, hence the name ""Ruilai Village"". At present, the residents of Manwikkul near the Tiaoda Hall are called Xiya because the village is located on the west side of the stream, and there is Qinglong Mountain behind it. Ruilai Village has become a gathering place for French people since 1985 with the relocation of the French School in South Korea (Ecole Francaise de Seoul). In 2008, there were more than 1,000 French people living in South Korea, and about half of them lived here. Since then, more and more foreigners have chosen to settle here, making Ruilai Village an international residential community. Because it is geographically close to Gangnam, known as the ""trade center"", it also has scenic spots such as Yangjaecheon, Hanjiang Park, and Umyeonsan Mountain, so it is favored by tourists at home and abroad. In recent years, Ruilai Village has undergone tremendous changes. Each hutong has many entertainment facilities such as wine bars and high-end coffee shops. Visitors can enjoy food or refreshments while bathing in the sun."
