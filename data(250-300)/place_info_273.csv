Maiko Kobayashi, who is holding her second solo exhibition with Jo Eun Gallery, uses a unique modeling language to express creatures reminiscent of animals, such as rabbits and dogs. The characters that Kobayashi repeatedly depicts are not simply borrowed from animation or manga, but are closer to natural, pure expressions of consciousness, like a child's doodles. As a person, the artist projects her own emotions into the work, extracting her inner feelings and thoughts through the movements of her hands, which become lines and colors on the canvas, presenting herself as a concrete ""existence"". The ""existence"" created by the artist gazes at the viewer or the unknown, as if they are their own living creatures. These characters go beyond simple ""kawaii"" (cuteness) and give people a sense of fragility or danger, similar to our human imagination, which is difficult to clearly define and cannot be simplified, such as love and sadness, fragility and strength, depression and hope. In particular, the artist, who values ​​materials, tears up traditional Japanese washi paper, rubs it, sometimes glues it together, and then sticks it on a board or canvas, adding a delicate and strong texture to the whole work. The artist believes that the fragile yet tough nature of washi paper is much like human nature. Just like the note in the corner of his studio that reads ""Even when times are difficult, there are times to face real life"", Kobayashi's life and art are inspired by the strong vitality of human beings to survive in chaotic times. According to this, Kudo Takeshi, director of the Tagawa City Art Museum, said that the strong and rich ""layers"" of lines and colors created by Kobayashi are the beauty created by the ""layers"" of consciousness of people living in modern society. It is said that the ""existence"" in the work is ultimately not the artist himself, but a portrait of a modern person, the face of all of us, beyond the self."
