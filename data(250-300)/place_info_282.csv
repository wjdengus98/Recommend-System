In October 2009, it was finally built as Pocheon Art Valley. Taking full advantage of the original quarry terrain, a sculpture park, exhibition hall, and amphitheater have been constructed. The quarry valley has also been used to build an observatory, a stone culture exhibition hall, and a monorail. There are many things to see. And in the Art Valley, you can also experience culture, art, and education, give play to unlimited imagination, and integrate nature with people."
