This exhibition features 32 new works that reflect a collection of memory fragments that are like afterimages mixed with various colors, containing warm moments and promises that we will not forget all the moments we encounter in the future. Kang Joon-seok realized the limitations of tiny humans in nature and the weaknesses he felt in the vast nature, and began to create works using vast lands, abandoned swimming pools, and amusement parks as backgrounds. The main location of the works is Jeju Island, where the artist actually lives, and all the scenery depicted helps us escape from complex thoughts and reflect on stability and leisure. The personal space you live in, such as your home or the community you live in, always exists. For modern people who live a busy life every day, it is the perfect space to rest and escape. This secret space where nothing disturbs me is my best place, the only place that understands me the most and embraces me. In addition, the simple and comfortable backgrounds in Kang Joon-seok's works, which are not easy to feel the perspective, maximize psychological stability. These elements play an important role in helping viewers discover themselves in the works, find inner peace, and fully face their emotions. This solo exhibition ""Melange"" exhibits new works that project the complex inner self by mixing various floating thoughts and emotions. Starting with strong colors similar to raw emotions, Jiang Junshi found and presented the appropriate emotional range through the process of layering and building colors. In this exhibition, we hope to boldly express the two inner conflicts of wanting to maintain the present and longing for change through a sense of layering that does not rely on a specific shape or appearance. In addition, he uses memory and experience as the great roots of his works, and blooms into various forms through various imaginations. Through this new work, I want to collect some memories of vague topics and re-examine the mixture of different color memories.    In this exhibition, Jiang Junshi honestly captures the thoughts and emotions of the scene at the moment, redefines the theme in his own way, and unfolds the landscape where memory and imagination blend. You can feel the artist's new look and deeper feelings. Diverse emotions, enjoy the work, and hope that this can be a moment to recall the precious memories we missed."

In the past, people here used wooden planks to cover the shops for travelers traveling between Kaesong and Seoul, and called them Panmunjom. Over time, this title became a place name. At a post before entering the demilitarized zone, an officer of the Korean People's Army will give tourists a brief introduction to the geography of the Panmunjom area and the direction of the military demarcation line, and remind some precautions after entering the demilitarized zone. Then, the tourists came to a small courtyard by car. There are two buildings there, one is the Armistice Negotiation Conference Hall. Another building is the Armistice Signing Field. After coming out of this courtyard, and then traveling by car, we arrived at the Panmunjom Common Guard Area, which has attracted the attention of the world. Only then did we arrive at the real Panmunjom. Panmunjom is located in the southeast of Kaicheng, 8 kilometers away from the city center. On July 27, 1953, the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed here, and Panmunjom became known to the world. It is not only a testimony to the three-year tragic Korean War, but also a symbol of ethnic division on the Korean peninsula. There is a meeting place for the Korean Armistice Negotiations to sign the Armistice Agreement, and there are the Military Armistice Committee Conference Room and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Committee Conference Room on the demarcation line. With the dividing line as the boundary, the north and the south each have their own sentries. Tourists visiting Panmunjom are really just visiting the meeting room of the Military Armistice Commission. There is one door at each end of the meeting room. When the tourist of the party enters the conference room, the door of the other party will be closed. The local security guard will stand in front of the door to prevent tourists from going out into the other area. The tables and chairs in the conference room are arranged as they are. Seven wooden single-storey buildings, including the Conference Room of the Military Armistice Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Committee, are lined up in a row. Among them, three blue buildings were built by the DPRK and China and managed by the DPRK and China, and four white buildings are "" It was built by the United Nations Army and managed by the United Nations Army. A cement marking line with a width of about 50 cm and a height of about 5 cm runs across the middle of these buildings, becoming a sacred military demarcation line."

This exhibition features 32 new works that reflect a collection of memory fragments that are like afterimages mixed with various colors, containing warm moments and promises that we will not forget all the moments we encounter in the future. Kang Joon-seok realized the limitations of tiny humans in nature and the weaknesses he felt in the vast nature, and began to create works using vast lands, abandoned swimming pools, and amusement parks as backgrounds. The main location of the works is Jeju Island, where the artist actually lives, and all the scenery depicted helps us escape from complex thoughts and reflect on stability and leisure. The personal space you live in, such as your home or the community you live in, always exists. For modern people who live a busy life every day, it is the perfect space to rest and escape. This secret space where nothing disturbs me is my best place, the only place that understands me the most and embraces me. In addition, the simple and comfortable backgrounds in Kang Joon-seok's works, which are not easy to feel the perspective, maximize psychological stability. These elements play an important role in helping viewers discover themselves in the works, find inner peace, and fully face their emotions. This solo exhibition ""Melange"" exhibits new works that project the complex inner self by mixing various floating thoughts and emotions. Starting with strong colors similar to raw emotions, Jiang Junshi found and presented the appropriate emotional range through the process of layering and building colors. In this exhibition, we hope to boldly express the two inner conflicts of wanting to maintain the present and longing for change through a sense of layering that does not rely on a specific shape or appearance. In addition, he uses memory and experience as the great roots of his works, and blooms into various forms through various imaginations. Through this new work, I want to collect some memories of vague topics and re-examine the mixture of different color memories.    In this exhibition, Jiang Junshi honestly captures the thoughts and emotions of the scene at the moment, redefines the theme in his own way, and unfolds the landscape where memory and imagination blend. You can feel the artist's new look and deeper feelings. Diverse emotions, enjoy the work, and hope that this can be a moment to recall the precious memories we missed."

The entire park covers an area of 3.5 million square meters. Among them, the 660,000-square-meter space centered on the abandoned salt field was opened in June 1999. The ecological exhibition hall here was rebuilt on the basis of the salt field warehouse. The photos of the halophytes such as lavender root and begonia flower, the scene of salt making, and the photos of Sulai port are displayed in the hall. In April 2001, the Wetland Park carried out the expansion project of ecological learning space, and built the park consultation hall, biological mural hall, natural energy experience hall, Incheon 21st publicity hall, and Incheon environmental NGO activity situation hall. In the natural learning field near the exhibition hall, educational videos related to the plants and salt fields of the ecological park are prepared for visitors, and there are classrooms with desks, chairs, and screens. The ecological park is aimed at primary school students. It is open five days a week from June to July and September to October each year, providing students with 20 minutes of study time. The Yantian Learning Field was built after the restoration of abandoned salt fields, covering an area of 40,000 square meters. Here, 400~1,200kg of salt can be produced every day. You can directly observe the process of salt production, see the salt field shaped like a Go chessboard and the working scene of workers pumping seawater with water trucks. Especially if you go during the salt collection time (usually 4:00 p.m.), you can also directly participate in the salt shovel experience activity. Next to the Yantian Learning Field, there is a mudflat experience field where you can go barefoot to catch crabs and dig shells. The surrounding area is a freshwater lotus pond inhabited by goldfish and carp. Since the park opened in June 1999, it has been loved by the citizens of the capital area. The park is only a five-minute drive from the expressway intersection. tree door."

It is one of the tributaries of the Han River. Along the direction of Yangjaecheon to Dogu-dong and Daechi-dong, there is a 2.8-kilometer-long healthy pedestrian walkway called Yangjaecheon Walkway. In April, when the cherry trees on the two sides of the preliminary road are in full bloom, a cherry blossom tunnel is formed. The exotic features that complement each other with the towering Metasequoia trees on Yangjaecheon Road are a good route for driving, also known as the ""street light road"". Mainly because at night, the street lamps among the densely lined streets and trees will light up one by one, and the beautiful scenery is quite romantic and deeply loved by couples. In addition, Yangjaecheon Bicycle Trail, which connects Gwacheon to Gangnam, is also a good place for friends who like outdoor sports to enjoy leisure and holiday time."

The piers of this fortress were only completed in 1679. In 1745, it was rebuilt into a complete stone city, with a city gate at that time. Guang Castle was severely attacked when Xinweiyang harassed it. On April 24, 1871, Will Rogers of the United States led a fleet of 1,230 troops to attack in order to demand trade. The troops successfully occupied Caozhiling and Dejin. After the town, they met the Korean army at Guang Castle again."

Ha Jung-woo continues his work based on his interest in everyday objects and people. The characters in his works are expressed with simple lines, bright colors, and simplified shapes stand out. By emphasizing the eyes, nose, and mouth on exaggerated faces, the characters are injected with primitive vitality. In this exhibition, Ha Jung-woo shows the pure spirit and primitive power of primitive nature that he has long explored. The new works are inspired by carpet design and are composed of regular lines and geometric abstractions, emphasizing mystery and purity. By utilizing native patterns, we try to visually reveal the inner intuition of human beings. In addition, he interprets folk materials such as traditional Korean masks with modern sensibility and incorporates them into his works. Ha Jung-woo's works show people's efforts to restore the original purity of human beings and revitalize the sincerity and vitality of life in modern civilization. This exhibition traces the reinterpretation of primitive symbolic expressions, conveys resonance with the origin of human existence, and proposes new emotional discoveries."

As a painter, printmaker and illustrator, he did not belong to a specific school, but absorbed the diversity of the Art Nouveau in Montmartre, the avant-garde center of the time, and pioneered original shapes. Modern graphic posters, he is considered one of the greatest artists in the history of world art. This exhibition seeks to break away from the previous tendency to emphasize Lautrec's psychological defects and unfortunate life, and examine his art from a new perspective. I want to emphasize his freedom to interact with people despite his physical disability, his bohemian experimental spirit that did not belong to any school and freely accepted the Art Nouveau, and especially his humanistic spirit of observing the beauty behind charm and vulgarity. This exhibition explores the extraordinary nature of the art created by Toulouse-Lautrec, combining the vitality of the fin de siècle with humanism, exhibiting his monumental and fascinating works created in Montmartre, as well as posters that led the golden age of contemporary French Art Nouveau. Together with Lautrec, 159 masterpieces of prints by 13 artists, including Alphonse Mucha, are exhibited. The first part, ""Bohemia,"" explores Lautrec's bohemian experimental spirit, who freely embraced various artistic trends and did not belong to any school of painting. The second part, ""Humanists,"" examines Lautrec's human-centered paintings, which depict the lower classes of Montmartre with extraordinary humanity and emphasize his humanistic aspects. The third part, ""Stars of Montmartre,"" consists of works from the second half of his creative career, highlighting his artistic legacy that continues to this day. The final chapter, ""French Art Nouveau Posters,"" showcases the works of 13 artists who were contemporaries of Lautrec and dominated the golden age of French Art Nouveau poster art. It will be an interesting opportunity to compare their works, which have in common with Lautrec's in that they follow the lithographic medium and Art Nouveau trends, but also stand out from Lautrec's art with their own aesthetic consciousness."

There are thousands of owl-related objects in the museum, including owl-painted screens, plates, ceramics, watches and other handicrafts, as well as owl statues, stamps, etc. The museum was renovated on the basis of residential buildings. It is not large in size, but it is full of warm atmosphere. The museum is very close to Bukchon Hanok Village, but because it is located in a small alley, it is not easy to find. Therefore, there are signs at the entrance of the alley. The outer wall of the museum is full of owls, and the flower pots on the path leading to the museum are also full of cute owl signs of the museum. The more you walk in, the more you will feel It's like entering a fairy tale world. There is a gray owl stone sculpture at the entrance of the museum. It is not big inside. It is a big room with some tables and chairs in the middle. A cup of tea and drinks is provided for visitors who come to visit. Visitors can also freely paint on the spot with the brush provided on the table to draw the owl in their hearts, and can stay in the museum. The exhibition room in the museum is surrounded by cabinets on three walls, which display all kinds of owls, decorations, practical utensils, wall clocks and picture frames. There are paintings, carvings, metal, and wood, as long as you can get anything you want, it can be an owl. If you happen to go to the bathroom, you will find that the small bathroom is also full of owls. About not all places in the photo gallery can take pictures, only limited areas can take pictures, you can sit on a chair and take a photo with the owl. Of course, the staff of the museum will also be very enthusiastic to help tourists who are afraid of taking photos, and also guide tourists to take group photos at the gate. In addition, children who like to collect stamps can also ask the curator to knock on the notebook or white paper they bring as a souvenir."

As a painter, printmaker and illustrator, he did not belong to a specific school, but absorbed the diversity of the Art Nouveau in Montmartre, the avant-garde center of the time, and pioneered original shapes. Modern graphic posters, he is considered one of the greatest artists in the history of world art. This exhibition seeks to break away from the previous tendency to emphasize Lautrec's psychological defects and unfortunate life, and examine his art from a new perspective. I want to emphasize his freedom to interact with people despite his physical disability, his bohemian experimental spirit that did not belong to any school and freely accepted the Art Nouveau, and especially his humanistic spirit of observing the beauty behind charm and vulgarity. This exhibition explores the extraordinary nature of the art created by Toulouse-Lautrec, combining the vitality of the fin de siècle with humanism, exhibiting his monumental and fascinating works created in Montmartre, as well as posters that led the golden age of contemporary French Art Nouveau. Together with Lautrec, 159 masterpieces of prints by 13 artists, including Alphonse Mucha, are exhibited. The first part, ""Bohemia,"" explores Lautrec's bohemian experimental spirit, who freely embraced various artistic trends and did not belong to any school of painting. The second part, ""Humanists,"" examines Lautrec's human-centered paintings, which depict the lower classes of Montmartre with extraordinary humanity and emphasize his humanistic aspects. The third part, ""Stars of Montmartre,"" consists of works from the second half of his creative career, highlighting his artistic legacy that continues to this day. The final chapter, ""French Art Nouveau Posters,"" showcases the works of 13 artists who were contemporaries of Lautrec and dominated the golden age of French Art Nouveau poster art. It will be an interesting opportunity to compare their works, which have in common with Lautrec's in that they follow the lithographic medium and Art Nouveau trends, but also stand out from Lautrec's art with their own aesthetic consciousness."

Jackson Sim, who does not hesitate to express messages that reflect the contemporary era and sublimate pure art into popular art, is not satisfied, but explores new aesthetic fields, presenting a new series in each exhibition. The artist often discovers new methods of art from her little daughter, and this time, while coloring with her child, she felt the beauty of unexpected shapes created by the mixing of different colors, which led to the creation of the ""Palette"" series. Jackson Sim sees traces of change, and different colors are mixed together to form beautiful shapes. The blocks of pigment and the free-flowing mixed colors are reminiscent of the palette, an artistic tool. The artist presents three different forms, seeking the reversal between tool and work, and the accidental effects of pigment flow, entanglement, mixing, and dynamic materials created by the artist's instinctive sense stand out. The artist no longer seeks philosophical insights or explanations from the audience, but immerses herself in the aesthetic composition, gradually approaching lyrical abstract forms. Cartoon characters from popular culture, reinterpreted with strong colors and improvisational lines, spread like a scent in the air in<Air and Rolling Roses >, but are ultimately reduced to colors in the palette, erasing even the smallest form that makes the characters recognizable. It happens. The colors of the real world observed by the artist are transformed into a text composed of words and color names, a format that contains fundamental questions about the nature of things. The artist reproduces objects seen by the naked eye on the canvas with colors, subverting the concept between our perceived reality and color. Here we discover that the color of an object cannot be explained in one way. Realizing that the definition of color promised by society (e.g. apples are red, milk is white) has been simplified, we expand our understanding of the essence. The author uses the masses as the source of aesthetics and cheerfully expresses the positivity of capitalism. Jackson Shim's sincere wishes, muse and innocent code return to the essence of painting, but we can find traces of our favorite innocent existence in this ecstatic flow of colors. We hope that when the audience sees Jackson Shim's palette, they can remember their own essence and desires and find their own colors."

Maiko Kobayashi, who is holding her second solo exhibition with Jo Eun Gallery, uses a unique modeling language to express creatures reminiscent of animals, such as rabbits and dogs. The characters that Kobayashi repeatedly depicts are not simply borrowed from animation or manga, but are closer to natural, pure expressions of consciousness, like a child's doodles. As a person, the artist projects her own emotions into the work, extracting her inner feelings and thoughts through the movements of her hands, which become lines and colors on the canvas, presenting herself as a concrete ""existence"". The ""existence"" created by the artist gazes at the viewer or the unknown, as if they are their own living creatures. These characters go beyond simple ""kawaii"" (cuteness) and give people a sense of fragility or danger, similar to our human imagination, which is difficult to clearly define and cannot be simplified, such as love and sadness, fragility and strength, depression and hope. In particular, the artist, who values ​​materials, tears up traditional Japanese washi paper, rubs it, sometimes glues it together, and then sticks it on a board or canvas, adding a delicate and strong texture to the whole work. The artist believes that the fragile yet tough nature of washi paper is much like human nature. Just like the note in the corner of his studio that reads ""Even when times are difficult, there are times to face real life"", Kobayashi's life and art are inspired by the strong vitality of human beings to survive in chaotic times. According to this, Kudo Takeshi, director of the Tagawa City Art Museum, said that the strong and rich ""layers"" of lines and colors created by Kobayashi are the beauty created by the ""layers"" of consciousness of people living in modern society. It is said that the ""existence"" in the work is ultimately not the artist himself, but a portrait of a modern person, the face of all of us, beyond the self."

Rhythm is a physical principle and sequence of movements, such as breathing or heartbeat, which is invisible, like the flow of energy, but is related to the vitality of life and the emotions that flow between people. This exhibition not only examines musical rhythm and body rhythm, but also examines the process of energy transmission and circulation through rhythmic experience, and the repercussions caused by rhythm, extending it to collective rhythm and social rhythm, that is, the cohesion of driving forces. Commonality. The 11 participating artists/teams present different paths of thinking and behavior, breaking away from repetitive daily patterns and creating interactions with others. Through this, we can re-accept and carefully reinterpret repetitive daily behaviors and systems. Breaking away from the time and space bound by capital and institutions, participating in activities in a ritual way, immersing in festivals, or practicing solitary exercises are all about discovering different speeds and rhythmic patterns of daily life. At the same time, the activation of the score instructions in the exhibition hall, the performance of ""Workshop Week"", the sound performance, the lectures that generate energy circulation inside and outside the museum, etc., encourage visitors to participate and make the museum a place for communication. Make it work. The exhibition gives festive rhythms and changing rhythms to the daily lives of different subjects, suggesting that participants enter a new time and space."

However, recently, modern society is full of complex and contradictory phenomena that cannot be explained by simple past explanations. From a poststructuralist perspective, we begin to discover various cases through the media that allow us to understand more deeply the contradictions inherent in human life and social relations. This exhibition aims to reinterpret the complexity of modern society through the metaphor of ""cruel fairy tales"" and expand the symbols in fairy tales to the contemporary context. The metaphors of disability and prejudice revealed in the lines of the domestic TV series ""It's Okay to Be Bad 2020"" are an important starting point for the symbolic approach of this exhibition. Starting from the character's question ""Is it terrible to be different?"", the story of difference and fear, understanding and acceptance is linked to the fairy tale of Bluebeard, and the scene reflects the prejudices and fears of modern people. Since then, the story of Bluebeard has begun to be interpreted no longer as a simple cruel fairy tale, but as an important work symbolizing the story of women breaking taboos and gender conflicts. For example, works such as the music video of singer Le Seraphim's ""Eve, Psyche and Bluebeard's Wife"" and the Naver webtoon ""I Became Bluebeard's Wife"" are now reinterpreted in various cultural contents. This exhibition visually explores these themes through the collection of famous artists at home and abroad, such as In-ok Kim, Hwan-ki Kim, Seo-bo Park, U-hwan Lee, Seung-taek Jang, Nancy Lang, and David Gerstein."

The creek in front of the village is meandering, hence the name ""Ruilai Village"". At present, the residents of Manwikkul near the Tiaoda Hall are called Xiya because the village is located on the west side of the stream, and there is Qinglong Mountain behind it. Ruilai Village has become a gathering place for French people since 1985 with the relocation of the French School in South Korea (Ecole Francaise de Seoul). In 2008, there were more than 1,000 French people living in South Korea, and about half of them lived here. Since then, more and more foreigners have chosen to settle here, making Ruilai Village an international residential community. Because it is geographically close to Gangnam, known as the ""trade center"", it also has scenic spots such as Yangjaecheon, Hanjiang Park, and Umyeonsan Mountain, so it is favored by tourists at home and abroad. In recent years, Ruilai Village has undergone tremendous changes. Each hutong has many entertainment facilities such as wine bars and high-end coffee shops. Visitors can enjoy food or refreshments while bathing in the sun."
