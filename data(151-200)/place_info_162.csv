There are many restaurants, cafes and clothing stores with European flavors on both sides of Baixian Coffee Street, each of which looks like a postcard when photographed. The environment here is beautiful, and the atmosphere is better than that of Gangnam or Boulevard in Seoul. Here, you can experience the taste of life in the upper class of South Korea. It is recommended to slow down and appreciate it slowly. At the end of Banqiao Coffee Street is the retro-designed I’mHome Cafe, which is small and cute in appearance. I'mHome, which was already well-known in the past, became even more popular after the ""Star"" drama aired. It mainly serves a variety of brunch, and in the evening, you can also have a glass of wine here for an elegant drink."
