Can&#39;t even feel my feet from walking so many steps (maybe 5k steps or more) because every time I turn, there&#39;s a new spot to explore. Wait until 6 pm when they switch the lights on and it feels magical. This place is great with kids but not with strollers because it&#39;ll be a hilly walk.",4.0,2023-11-23 22:11:53
