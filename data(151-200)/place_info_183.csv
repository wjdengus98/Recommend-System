The piers of this fortress were only completed in 1679. In 1745, it was rebuilt into a complete stone city, with a city gate at that time. Guang Castle was severely attacked when Xinweiyang harassed it. On April 24, 1871, Will Rogers of the United States led a fleet of 1,230 troops to attack in order to demand trade. The troops successfully occupied Caozhiling and Dejin. After the town, they met the Korean army at Guang Castle again."
