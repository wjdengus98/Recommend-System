After checking the number of people boarded by the Korean gendarmerie armed with guns and bullets, the car traveled across the highway bridge on the Linjin River to the third tunnel. Leaving the third tunnel, we took a bus to Duro Prospecting Station. When we got off the bus, we saw the words &quot;the end of the split, the starting point of the unification&quot; painted in fascinating colors on the tall building. This is the closest place to the 38th Line in South Korea. There are more than a dozen high-powered telescopes in front of the Taipei Wall near the high platform. You can see the scenery of North Korea in the opposite direction with 500 won (equivalent to RMB 3 yuan). Unfortunately, Heaven is not beautiful. It is impossible to see the opposite scenery in the dark clouds. Maybe Heaven is unwilling to let us witness the tragedy of national division. There is a clear yellow warning line sign on the viewing platform. Tourists can only take pictures within the Yellow line. Because of the weather conditions on that day, there are basically no violations by tourists. Under the eaves of the viewing terrace hangs a huge landscape photograph, which clearly shows the location of Kaicheng, Sichuan River and the bronze statue of Kim Il Sung opposite Korea under a clear sky. We can only comfort ourselves by photographs, after all, standing in the northernmost part of Korea. There is a double-decked Pavilion near Duro Prospect Terrace. On the second floor, there is a big bell praying for peace. On the first floor, there is a small and exquisite Forward Peace Temple. In the empty courtyard outside the temple, there is a statue of Maitreya Buddha. There are also information films and TV circular broadcasting, because it is to introduce the Korean army&#39;s mighty and heroic content, so we did not go to join the fun.",5.0,2014-08-06 17:14:04
