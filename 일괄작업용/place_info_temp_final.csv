Then, the tourists came to a small courtyard by car. There are two buildings there, one is the Armistice Negotiation Conference Hall. Another building is the Armistice Signing Field. After coming out of this courtyard, and then traveling by car, we arrived at the Panmunjom Common Guard Area, which has attracted the attention of the world. Only then did we arrive at the real Panmunjom. Panmunjom is located in the southeast of Kaicheng, 8 kilometers away from the city center. On July 27, 1953, the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed here, and Panmunjom became known to the world. It is not only a testimony to the three-year tragic Korean War, but also a symbol of ethnic division on the Korean peninsula. There is a meeting place for the Korean Armistice Negotiations to sign the Armistice Agreement, and there are the Military Armistice Committee Conference Room and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Committee Conference Room on the demarcation line. With the dividing line as the boundary, the north and the south each have their own sentries. Tourists visiting Panmunjom are really just visiting the meeting room of the Military Armistice Commission. There is one door at each end of the meeting room. When the tourist of the party enters the conference room, the door of the other party will be closed. The local security guard will stand in front of the door to prevent tourists from going out into the other area. The tables and chairs in the conference room are arranged as they are. Seven wooden single-storey buildings, including the Conference Room of the Military Armistice Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Committee, are lined up in a row. Among them, three blue buildings were built by the DPRK and China and managed by the DPRK and China, and four white buildings are "" It was built by the United Nations Army and managed by the United Nations Army.

In April, when the cherry trees on the two sides of the preliminary road are in full bloom, a cherry blossom tunnel is formed. The exotic features that complement each other with the towering Metasequoia trees on Yangjaecheon Road are a good route for driving, also known as the ""street light road"". Mainly because at night, the street lamps among the densely lined streets and trees will light up one by one, and the beautiful scenery is quite romantic and deeply loved by couples. In addition, Yangjaecheon Bicycle Trail, which connects Gwacheon to Gangnam, is also a good place for friends who like outdoor sports to enjoy leisure and holiday time."

Maiko Kobayashi, who is holding her second solo exhibition with Jo Eun Gallery, uses a unique modeling language to express creatures reminiscent of animals, such as rabbits and dogs. The characters that Kobayashi repeatedly depicts are not simply borrowed from animation or manga, but are closer to natural, pure expressions of consciousness, like a child's doodles. As a person, the artist projects her own emotions into the work, extracting her inner feelings and thoughts through the movements of her hands, which become lines and colors on the canvas, presenting herself as a concrete ""existence"". The ""existence"" created by the artist gazes at the viewer or the unknown, as if they are their own living creatures. These characters go beyond simple ""kawaii"" (cuteness) and give people a sense of fragility or danger, similar to our human imagination, which is difficult to clearly define and cannot be simplified, such as love and sadness, fragility and strength, depression and hope. In particular, the artist, who values ​​materials, tears up traditional Japanese washi paper, rubs it, sometimes glues it together, and then sticks it on a board or canvas, adding a delicate and strong texture to the whole work. The artist believes that the fragile yet tough nature of washi paper is much like human nature. Just like the note in the corner of his studio that reads ""Even when times are difficult, there are times to face real life"", Kobayashi's life and art are inspired by the strong vitality of human beings to survive in chaotic times. According to this, Kudo Takeshi, director of the Tagawa City Art Museum, said that the strong and rich ""layers"" of lines and colors created by Kobayashi are the beauty created by the ""layers"" of consciousness of people living in modern society. It is said that the ""existence"" in the work is ultimately not the artist himself, but a portrait of a modern person, the face of all of us, beyond the self."

Since then, more and more foreigners have chosen to settle here, making Ruilai Village an international residential community. Because it is geographically close to Gangnam, known as the ""trade center"", it also has scenic spots such as Yangjaecheon, Hanjiang Park, and Umyeonsan Mountain, so it is favored by tourists at home and abroad.

This exhibition features 32 new works that reflect a collection of memory fragments that are like afterimages mixed with various colors, containing warm moments and promises that we will not forget all the moments we encounter in the future. Kang Joon-seok realized the limitations of tiny humans in nature and the weaknesses he felt in the vast nature, and began to create works using vast lands, abandoned swimming pools, and amusement parks as backgrounds. The main location of the works is Jeju Island, where the artist actually lives, and all the scenery depicted helps us escape from complex thoughts and reflect on stability and leisure. The personal space you live in, such as your home or the community you live in, always exists. For modern people who live a busy life every day, it is the perfect space to rest and escape. This secret space where nothing disturbs me is my best place, the only place that understands me the most and embraces me. In addition, the simple and comfortable backgrounds in Kang Joon-seok's works, which are not easy to feel the perspective, maximize psychological stability. These elements play an important role in helping viewers discover themselves in the works, find inner peace, and fully face their emotions. This solo exhibition ""Melange"" exhibits new works that project the complex inner self by mixing various floating thoughts and emotions. Starting with strong colors similar to raw emotions, Jiang Junshi found and presented the appropriate emotional range through the process of layering and building colors. In this exhibition, we hope to boldly express the two inner conflicts of wanting to maintain the present and longing for change through a sense of layering that does not rely on a specific shape or appearance. In addition, he uses memory and experience as the great roots of his works, and blooms into various forms through various imaginations. Through this new work, I want to collect some memories of vague topics and re-examine the mixture of different color memories.    In this exhibition, Jiang Junshi honestly captures the thoughts and emotions of the scene at the moment, redefines the theme in his own way, and unfolds the landscape where memory and imagination blend. You can feel the artist's new look and deeper feelings. Diverse emotions, enjoy the work, and hope that this can be a moment to recall the precious memories we missed."

One day I plant cuttings, another day I sow seeds. Sometimes the plants melt if I water too much, and die if I repot too early. There are many days when we just wait for new leaves to appear, not knowing when they will grow. Then I get tired and look at other people's trees with envy. The next spring, those still fuzzy seeds finally begin to sprout in the dirt in the corner"
