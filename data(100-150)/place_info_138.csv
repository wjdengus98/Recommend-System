It is one of the tributaries of the Han River. Along the direction of Yangjaecheon to Dogu-dong and Daechi-dong, there is a 2.8-kilometer-long healthy pedestrian walkway called Yangjaecheon Walkway. In April, when the cherry trees on the two sides of the preliminary road are in full bloom, a cherry blossom tunnel is formed. The exotic features that complement each other with the towering Metasequoia trees on Yangjaecheon Road are a good route for driving, also known as the ""street light road"". Mainly because at night, the street lamps among the densely lined streets and trees will light up one by one, and the beautiful scenery is quite romantic and deeply loved by couples. In addition, Yangjaecheon Bicycle Trail, which connects Gwacheon to Gangnam, is also a good place for friends who like outdoor sports to enjoy leisure and holiday time."
