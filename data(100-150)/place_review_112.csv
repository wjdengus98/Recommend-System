89861,https://ak-d.tripcdn.com/images/1h66f4224x8bzcytc0468.jpg,山水人生,"The car traveled 168 kilometers from Pyongyang to Panmunjom. This small village, 8 kilometers southeast of Kaicheng District of Korea, is famous for its signature of the Korean Armistice Agreement on July 27, 1953, and is now the site of the Special Committee for Liaison between the two Koreas. Led by an officer of the Korean People&#39;s Army, we began our tour. First, before the map of Korea and the schematic map of Panmunjom&#39;s location, the officer who served as the explainer briefly introduced the general situation of the armistice line and Panmunjom. Then he traveled on the road with wire mesh isolation and arrived at the North Korean Armistice Negotiation and Signature Site on the north side of the armistice line. After getting off the bus, the first thing you can see is the Korean flag tower which stands high over the roadside crops. Then you can see the Korean flag tower which echoes the Korean flag tower. It is said that this is the unique landscape of Panmunjom. The flag tower of South Korea is 100 meters high, while that of North Korea is 160 meters high. The flag length is 30 meters, which is known as the world&#39;s first. It has been seen in the newspapers and periodicals that the two Koreas had gone through a series of comparisons in the height of the two flag towers, competing for each other before giving in. In the end, North Korea took the lead with its &quot;fearlessness&quot; heroism at no economic cost. Under the leadership of the officers, we visited the negotiation room first. A very ordinary board room was situated in a clean environment decorated with green trees and flowers. Walking into the room, we can see that the restored negotiating table is placed among them. In the middle, a long table is divided into five seats opposite each other. The two long tables in the north and South seem to support the balance of the negotiating table in the limited space. As a commentator, the officer introduced the process of the Korean War negotiations to the tourists at the negotiation table. Another group of tour guides served as interpreters. Subsequently, we visited the Armistice Agreement Signature Hall in the same courtyard. On the night before the signing of the armistice agreement, engineers and technicians from both sides of the DPRK and China miraculously built this wooden hall with Korean national characteristics. In the morning of July 27, 1953, more than 200 journalists from all over the world came to interview the truce negotiations to witness that historical moment. Walking into the hall, I saw two rectangular conference tables parallel to the north in the middle of the empty room, which were the signature tables of the chief representatives of the two sides at that time. In the middle of the conference table is a square table with signature texts. The tables are covered with green cloth. The flag of the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea is standing on the conference table in the West and the United Nations flag is standing on the conference table in the east. Then we took another bus to Panmunjom, the &quot;real&quot; shop that we often see on TV, on the truce front. After the Korean Armistice, the two Koreas have built many buildings of a certain scale in this &quot;common security area&quot; and many famous talks between the two Koreas have been held here. We saw soldiers standing guard outside the Panfang Gate on the Korean side, while no one was seen on the Korean side, but more than a dozen cameras on the third floor platform of the tall building opposite were watching us attentively.",5.0,2014-07-07 17:31:23
