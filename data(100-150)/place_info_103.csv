Therefore, there is such a scene on the summit of Nanshan: the ancient pavilion that follows the historical tradition and the new tower representing the new present are neighbors without disturbing each other and in a tacit understanding. The pavilion is not big. Tourists will take pictures here. When they are tired, they will rest here. Many tourists will meet with their companions and friends to eat and chat here. Time flies slowly without knowing it."
