This exhibition features 32 new works that reflect a collection of memory fragments that are like afterimages mixed with various colors, containing warm moments and promises that we will not forget all the moments we encounter in the future. Kang Joon-seok realized the limitations of tiny humans in nature and the weaknesses he felt in the vast nature, and began to create works using vast lands, abandoned swimming pools, and amusement parks as backgrounds. The main location of the works is Jeju Island, where the artist actually lives, and all the scenery depicted helps us escape from complex thoughts and reflect on stability and leisure. The personal space you live in, such as your home or the community you live in, always exists. For modern people who live a busy life every day, it is the perfect space to rest and escape. This secret space where nothing disturbs me is my best place, the only place that understands me the most and embraces me. In addition, the simple and comfortable backgrounds in Kang Joon-seok's works, which are not easy to feel the perspective, maximize psychological stability. These elements play an important role in helping viewers discover themselves in the works, find inner peace, and fully face their emotions. This solo exhibition ""Melange"" exhibits new works that project the complex inner self by mixing various floating thoughts and emotions. Starting with strong colors similar to raw emotions, Jiang Junshi found and presented the appropriate emotional range through the process of layering and building colors. In this exhibition, we hope to boldly express the two inner conflicts of wanting to maintain the present and longing for change through a sense of layering that does not rely on a specific shape or appearance. In addition, he uses memory and experience as the great roots of his works, and blooms into various forms through various imaginations. Through this new work, I want to collect some memories of vague topics and re-examine the mixture of different color memories.    In this exhibition, Jiang Junshi honestly captures the thoughts and emotions of the scene at the moment, redefines the theme in his own way, and unfolds the landscape where memory and imagination blend. You can feel the artist's new look and deeper feelings. Diverse emotions, enjoy the work, and hope that this can be a moment to recall the precious memories we missed."
