The entire park covers an area of 3.5 million square meters. Among them, the 660,000-square-meter space centered on the abandoned salt field was opened in June 1999. The ecological exhibition hall here was rebuilt on the basis of the salt field warehouse. The photos of the halophytes such as lavender root and begonia flower, the scene of salt making, and the photos of Sulai port are displayed in the hall. In April 2001, the Wetland Park carried out the expansion project of ecological learning space, and built the park consultation hall, biological mural hall, natural energy experience hall, Incheon 21st publicity hall, and Incheon environmental NGO activity situation hall. In the natural learning field near the exhibition hall, educational videos related to the plants and salt fields of the ecological park are prepared for visitors, and there are classrooms with desks, chairs, and screens. The ecological park is aimed at primary school students. It is open five days a week from June to July and September to October each year, providing students with 20 minutes of study time. The Yantian Learning Field was built after the restoration of abandoned salt fields, covering an area of 40,000 square meters. Here, 400~1,200kg of salt can be produced every day. You can directly observe the process of salt production, see the salt field shaped like a Go chessboard and the working scene of workers pumping seawater with water trucks. Especially if you go during the salt collection time (usually 4:00 p.m.), you can also directly participate in the salt shovel experience activity. Next to the Yantian Learning Field, there is a mudflat experience field where you can go barefoot to catch crabs and dig shells. The surrounding area is a freshwater lotus pond inhabited by goldfish and carp. Since the park opened in June 1999, it has been loved by the citizens of the capital area. The park is only a five-minute drive from the expressway intersection. tree door."
