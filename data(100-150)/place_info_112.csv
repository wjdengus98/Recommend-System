In the past, people here used wooden planks to cover the shops for travelers traveling between Kaesong and Seoul, and called them Panmunjom. Over time, this title became a place name. At a post before entering the demilitarized zone, an officer of the Korean People's Army will give tourists a brief introduction to the geography of the Panmunjom area and the direction of the military demarcation line, and remind some precautions after entering the demilitarized zone. Then, the tourists came to a small courtyard by car. There are two buildings there, one is the Armistice Negotiation Conference Hall. Another building is the Armistice Signing Field. After coming out of this courtyard, and then traveling by car, we arrived at the Panmunjom Common Guard Area, which has attracted the attention of the world. Only then did we arrive at the real Panmunjom. Panmunjom is located in the southeast of Kaicheng, 8 kilometers away from the city center. On July 27, 1953, the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed here, and Panmunjom became known to the world. It is not only a testimony to the three-year tragic Korean War, but also a symbol of ethnic division on the Korean peninsula. There is a meeting place for the Korean Armistice Negotiations to sign the Armistice Agreement, and there are the Military Armistice Committee Conference Room and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Committee Conference Room on the demarcation line. With the dividing line as the boundary, the north and the south each have their own sentries. Tourists visiting Panmunjom are really just visiting the meeting room of the Military Armistice Commission. There is one door at each end of the meeting room. When the tourist of the party enters the conference room, the door of the other party will be closed. The local security guard will stand in front of the door to prevent tourists from going out into the other area. The tables and chairs in the conference room are arranged as they are. Seven wooden single-storey buildings, including the Conference Room of the Military Armistice Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Committee, are lined up in a row. Among them, three blue buildings were built by the DPRK and China and managed by the DPRK and China, and four white buildings are "" It was built by the United Nations Army and managed by the United Nations Army. A cement marking line with a width of about 50 cm and a height of about 5 cm runs across the middle of these buildings, becoming a sacred military demarcation line."
