149297764,Toulouse-Lautrec : The Star of Montmartre,0.0,https://ak-d.tripcdn.com/images/0104512000cf2so817903.png,Seoul,['Exhibitions'],GCJ02,37.507644,127.060484,"My Art Museum, Seoul, Korea","Henri de Toulouse Lautrec was an artist from a French aristocratic family, known for his unique, charming and provocative handwriting lithographs of Parisian nightlife during the Belle Époque. As a painter, printmaker and illustrator, he did not belong to a specific school, but absorbed the diversity of the Art Nouveau in Montmartre, the avant-garde center of the time, and pioneered original shapes. Modern graphic posters, he is considered one of the greatest artists in the history of world art. This exhibition seeks to break away from the previous tendency to emphasize Lautrec's psychological defects and unfortunate life, and examine his art from a new perspective. I want to emphasize his freedom to interact with people despite his physical disability, his bohemian experimental spirit that did not belong to any school and freely accepted the Art Nouveau, and especially his humanistic spirit of observing the beauty behind charm and vulgarity. This exhibition explores the extraordinary nature of the art created by Toulouse-Lautrec, combining the vitality of the fin de siècle with humanism, exhibiting his monumental and fascinating works created in Montmartre, as well as posters that led the golden age of contemporary French Art Nouveau. Together with Lautrec, 159 masterpieces of prints by 13 artists, including Alphonse Mucha, are exhibited. The first part, ""Bohemia,"" explores Lautrec's bohemian experimental spirit, who freely embraced various artistic trends and did not belong to any school of painting. The second part, ""Humanists,"" examines Lautrec's human-centered paintings, which depict the lower classes of Montmartre with extraordinary humanity and emphasize his humanistic aspects. The third part, ""Stars of Montmartre,"" consists of works from the second half of his creative career, highlighting his artistic legacy that continues to this day. The final chapter, ""French Art Nouveau Posters,"" showcases the works of 13 artists who were contemporaries of Lautrec and dominated the golden age of French Art Nouveau poster art. It will be an interesting opportunity to compare their works, which have in common with Lautrec's in that they follow the lithographic medium and Art Nouveau trends, but also stand out from Lautrec's art with their own aesthetic consciousness."
