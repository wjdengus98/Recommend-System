The building is located on the east side of Gwanghwamunqian Street in Gyeongbokgung Palace. It stands alone in the center of the street, making it very special. Gyeongbokgung Palace is the only palace in the form of a corner tower among the five major palaces in North Korea. In the past, there were two watchtowers in the two corners of the front wall of Gyeongbokgung Palace, namely the East Cross Pavilion and the West Cross Pavilion. However, the West Cross Pavilion was demolished during the Japanese occupation, and the East Cross Pavilion was left alone outside the wall due to the expansion of the road. Modern civilization and ancient culture, reinforced concrete and civil masonry, skyscrapers and carved small buildings, can not but say that it is a fusion of perceptual beauty."
