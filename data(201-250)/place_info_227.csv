The author compares people who have no entity or whose mass is constantly changing to ""people without mass."" Although we live with billions of people, the people the author depicts are people whose reality is blurred. They are ""protagonists in myths,"" ""anthropomorphic abstract concepts,"" ""media characters"" that appear and disappear quickly, and ""contemporary people"" that disappear slowly. Rapidly changing interpersonal relationships, information, and the disappearance of identity can also be seen as ""masslessness."""
