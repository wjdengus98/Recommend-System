It says the grade of the officials and stipulates the position of the officials to kneel. It is very disciplined. I also took a picture with the stone tablets from Jiupin.,5.0,2020-06-26 12:59:02

There are Sendai Mausoleums and Zeno-den, the third generation Nas Tsunamu mausoleums in the surrounding area. Unsurprisingly, it is the Sendai Date series. The tomb was in a tree-covered sacred atmosphere. Masamune Date died at the end of the Sendai clan mansion in Hibiya Park near Edo Castle, but after the death, his retainers ordered him to live here. It was once a national treasure, but burned down in 1945 and the current building has been rebuilt. It was gorgeous anyway, and there were beautiful sculptures in every corner, which made me lament. The date meant he was always fashionable, but that was exactly the atmosphere that suited him. By the way, Edo Shogunate was well approved of its construction even with the trust of the Shogunate. I think it was simpler. Even if it wasn&#39;t as close as the Sunshine East Zhao Palace, no other clan could be as flashy as it is now.",5.0,2020-06-22 22:35:25

There is really nothing to look at. The exquisiteness of the building is not comparable to the design structure of the overall courtyard.

Famous for its meticulously decorated algae wells, the palace has a imperial throne. The great building behind the palace is the royal bedroom palace. Another temple, which is still the residence of the surviving royals, is a traditional wooden structure in South Korea. The temple is displayed with crowns, king&#39;s clothes, ink treasures, weapons and other handicrafts.",5.0,2019-08-11 12:24:51
