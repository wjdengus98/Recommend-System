There were many same tourists and only two people could enter the tunnel side by side, so it was full of people going and returning, but I had a very good experience. The return slope is a little loose, so you need a little physical strength. If there are many people, it may be difficult due to lack of oxygen. After leaving the tunnel, I was able to see a historic image. Since it was a Japanese tour, I was able to hear various stories back and forth ． Since it was a tour, I went to other places, but the tunnel was quite impressive and nice! !!",5.0,2023-09-06 23:15:56
