Ha Jung-woo continues his work based on his interest in everyday objects and people. The characters in his works are expressed with simple lines, bright colors, and simplified shapes stand out. By emphasizing the eyes, nose, and mouth on exaggerated faces, the characters are injected with primitive vitality. In this exhibition, Ha Jung-woo shows the pure spirit and primitive power of primitive nature that he has long explored. The new works are inspired by carpet design and are composed of regular lines and geometric abstractions, emphasizing mystery and purity. By utilizing native patterns, we try to visually reveal the inner intuition of human beings. In addition, he interprets folk materials such as traditional Korean masks with modern sensibility and incorporates them into his works. Ha Jung-woo's works show people's efforts to restore the original purity of human beings and revitalize the sincerity and vitality of life in modern civilization. This exhibition traces the reinterpretation of primitive symbolic expressions, conveys resonance with the origin of human existence, and proposes new emotional discoveries."
